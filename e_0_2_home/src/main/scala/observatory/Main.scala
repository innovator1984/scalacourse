/*
We updated the grader to give you clearer messages when grading an uncompleted milestone. Instead of seeing failure due to a missing implementation you will see an error message saying that the corresponding milestone has been disabled.

You can now configure which milestones should be graded via the Grading.milestone value (in the project source code). For instance, if you completed the 2nd milestone, set this value to 2.

For learners who already downloaded the assignment and started working on it, you will have to re-download it (here) and copy the src/main/scala/observatory/Grading.scala file to your project (and update the Grading.milestone value, if needed).
